<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently working toward a PhD degree in Psychology at the Center for Psychological Sciences (浙江大学心理科学研究中心), Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Prof. Peng Liu. I am also affiliated with the Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences (浙江大学心理与行为科学系), Zhejiang University.

I graduated from the Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences at Zhejiang University with a bachelor’s degree. 

My research interests include areas of machine psychology, such as human-automation interaction (HAI). As highly automated agents are integrated into society, their role in HAI is evolving from being mere tools to acting as teammates or social actors. I am interested in various kinds of automated agents, including automated vehicles, large language models, and algorithms.
